            <p>The iconic purple gift wrapped Haldiram&rsquo;s or Bicano&rsquo;s pack spelling those heavenly words, not merely words but emotions: &lsquo;Soan Papdi&rsquo;. None of us can ever forget the excitement of the good old days of us dressing up in the newest collection of our wardrobes, adorning bright and beautiful clothes while keenly trying to keep an eye for when the fireworks began. Amidst all the excitement of holy rituals and pooja, our parents exchanged sweets and we&rsquo;d go share sweets while exchanging pleasantries. The excitement was such that the festivities, preparing our homes to welcome Goddess Laxmi for pooja and buying gifts and clothes for our loved ones began at least a month before the actual Diwali day! We were super excited for the festive season packed with all the fun in meeting our friends and cousins, eating good food but the most exciting part was receiving tons of chocolates, sweets and beautiful gifts from our loved ones.</p>
            <p>However, with the shift in decade, with great leaps in our market place and tastes, the mass-produced gifts like our beloved soan papdi or Kurkure gift packs have been taken over by personalised gifting options. The personal touch of the modern options helps our friends and family know that we care while the underlying tone very subtle manner screams &ldquo;Hurray! It&rsquo;s festival time, it is indeed Diwali!&rdquo; What&rsquo;s lovely about these personalised gifting is that you don&rsquo;t really have to worry much about the price or fixed features like the goods from our childhood days. In the current dynamic marketplace, the ecosystem can match any and every individual&rsquo;s wavelength especially with more and more small businesses coming into the picture. The motive is no more to just see goods, it has been replaced to see love and emotion both from producers to buyers and to the loved ones of the buyers.</p>
            <p>Now a question comes to mind. We do want such gifting options but how to manage finding different options and comparing them to find our personal best fit. Don&rsquo;t worry, Gharobaar to the rescue!

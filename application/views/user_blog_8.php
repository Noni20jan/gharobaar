        <p class="blog-sub-heading">Meta description - Design logo online with easy steps. An ideal logo generates credibility &amp; provides a distinguishable image in the market. </p>
        <div class="blog-2-headinng-content">
            <p>Logo creation is important for every business &amp; it takes considerable resources to get a logo made. Have you ever come across a reputable &amp; distinguished Brand that did not have a logo? Well no, because a Brand like that cannot exist. </p>
            <p>Logos might seem to be the part of a brand that can be managed later, but a lot of factors depend only on the logo. A good logo can make you roll in money, while the one that fails to convey the idea of your business to the public would lead to a complete disaster. </p>
            <p>Companies invest a lot of their funds only to get a logo created. Although there are more works to do that demand appropriate attention &amp; detail like Whitepapers, Prototypes, Social Media Campaigns &amp; much more, a minimalistic element like a logo requires a lot of effort. Thus while selecting a logo, many factors have to be kept in mind. </p>
            <h2 class="points-heading">How does a logo create all the difference? </h2>
            <p>You will agree to the point that going to Starbucks would be in vain if you cannot hold your cup with utmost pride &amp; click pictures with your friends. Or if you go to a mall &amp; come back home without your favorite hoodie with Nike's logo printed on it, nothing would be more regretful. </p>
            <p>A brand goes through a lot of severe conditions to be recognized in the market &amp; to attain a point when people not only hail it but want it. Thus, a logo is the manifestation of a brand &amp; where it stands in the market. In the case of newly established enterprises, a logo acts as a catalyst to create awareness amongst the masses &amp; form a common perception. </p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Establishes Brand Identity - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Brands that are highly coveted in the market enjoy a steady rise in profits &amp; </p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Ensures customer loyalty - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rapper Drake has rightly said, "checks over stripes" which denotes he prefers Nike over Adidas. It's his choice after all, but it also implies that he is devoted to buying only from one brand than the other. This is called brand loyalty. If you have purchased headphones from a company like Skullcandy, you will tend to buy the new ones from the same company (if its logo &amp; functions resonate with you). </p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Conveys Brand intentions - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A gaming cafe will probably design a logo that has neon lights adumbrated with a dark, aggressive grey shade. A kids' clothing brand will prefer a logo that looks poppy &amp; colorful. If either of the two replaces each other, the brand intentions will be mixed &amp; it would not make any sense. Thus, a logo conveys brand intentions through its simple yet unique design.</p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Supports credibility- </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A logo is like the face of a brand. If the logo is appealing, then customers would be willing enough to buy the brand. A good logo establishes confidence in the public regarding your business &amp; enhances your credibility. </p>
            <h2 class="points-heading">What should a logo be like?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Unique Distinctive - Something never been made before</li>
                <li>Easy to remember - That can get engraved in mind with just a glimpse</li>
                <li>Simple - Shall be understandable by common people</li>
                <li>Timeless - so that you do not have to redesign it over the years.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Types of Logos that could go well with your Brand:</p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">1.Monograms (Letter marks) - </h4>
            <p>Letter marks or monograms are simple logos that include letters for making the logo. Many companies prefer to go by their initials like H&amp;M, ESPN, IBM &amp; much more. These logos are basic yet are successful enough to impress the customers. </p>
            <p>However, Monograms might not be good at defining your business. Sometimes, the abbreviation of your name might give you ridiculous results. For example, considering the initials of the name "The History Union of Guinea" would be THUG, &amp; it is not going well with the name of the association. Avoid such abbreviations &amp; consider more practical examples. </p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">2.Wordmarks - </h4>
            <p>Just straightway using the company name as the logo is the best description for a wordmark. It is better to have a wordmark logo if your company name is short &amp; simple. With some elements of design &amp; creativity, you can create a good wordmark for your business. Unlike Monograms, Wordmarks have no abbreviations. The best examples of Wordmarks are Nike, FedEx, Vans, Google, Microsoft &amp; Coca-Cola. </p>
            <p>While considering a wordmark, always make sure that: </p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Your brand name is simple &amp; short. </li>
                <li> Your brand name is unique &amp; is capable of creating an impact on the people. </li>
                <li> Designs can be easily incorporated with your brand name.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">3.Abstract - </h4>
            <p>Logos that consist of designs that neither define your business nor do establish a connection with the brand name but render aesthetics are abstract logos. They can be in the form of intricate geometrical designs or simple figures that go well with the brand name. For example, Apps like Slack &amp; Clickup use simple yet intriguing logos for their mobile versions.</p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">4.Emblem - </h4>
            <p>A logo that proudly endorses your brand by the sly use of strong pictorial elements &amp; bold letters to convey brand intentions is an emblem logo. The letters in an emblem logo are well integrated with the design. An emblem logo looks pretty classic. If your brand is old, you can use an emblem logo that would fit your purpose.</p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">5.Pictorial - </h4>
            <p>Pictorial logos use a practical design that clearly defines the brand name. For example, Apple. These logos are easily distinguishable &amp; establish a connection with the brand name. You can choose an intricate or a simple design for your logo, but make sure it goes well with your brand name. </p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">6.Mascots - </h4>
            <p>Mascots are like the imaginary endorsers of your brand that are put in an animated form in your logo. The most famous example of a mascot logo was Shera for Commonwealth Games in the year 2010. Mascots are cheerful, bubbly &amp; friendly, just like a cartoon. </p>
            <h4 class="points-heading-2">7.Combination - </h4>
            <p>A combination logo uses the complete brand name as well as design elements to convey the brand. It is truly the combination of Wordmark and Pictorial logo. Let us take The Nation as an example. The logo uses the brand name &amp; a flag to give an idea of the brand. </p>
            <h2 class="points-heading">How to design a logo for your brand: </h2>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li> Pick the right color - </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Orange</strong>: It is not among the most used colors but can be a good choice for making your logo look playful unique. </p>

            <p><strong>Pink</strong>: It is the most common color that is used for feminine brands or other youthful brands. Pink is a very soothing color that is well suited for Bakeries, Spas, Boutiques much more.</p>
            <p><strong>Brown</strong>: Brown may sound like a strange color choice at first, but it works perfectly for rugged and masculine vintage logos. It can give your brand a handmade, unique, and aged look.</p>
            <p><strong>Black</strong>: Simple classy is another word for the color black. Digital brands use black more often to assert a minimalistic look. </p>
            <p><strong>White</strong>: Like black, White is minimalistic too but it delivers a clean bold image of a logo. It adds an economical touch to the brand works well with other colors.</p>
            <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Gray is a color that many brands are adopting recently. It is more of a mysterious and intriguing color that gives your logo a classic touch. </span></p>

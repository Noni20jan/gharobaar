            <p><span>Many bloggers on Social Media are helping normalize gender-fluid fashion through their creativity &amp; accessibility to the masses. While women are doing their part, guys too are embracing the androgynous form of fashion in their way- wearing makeup, accessories, &amp; colors that are usually perceived to be fit for women. </span></p>

            <br>
            <p><strong><span>WHAT ARE NEUTRAL COLORS? HOW TO WEAR THEM? </span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Neutral colors are calming and relaxing to the eye &amp; include shades of black, white, ivory, cream, and grey. </span></p>
            <p><span>Colors like Orange &amp; purple, though being bright colors are somewhat gender-fluid too, as they do not define their attribution to a particular gender. </span></p>
            <p><span>The beauty of wearing neutrals is that they all pair together. Instead of competing with each other, you can simply pair any of the two-three pieces together. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s imperative to have at least some Gender-neutral pieces, that way you can make the most of your closet.</span></p>
            <p><span>Some colors have neutral-like characteristics, such as earth tones like sage and olive greens, burnt orange, sand, and shades of blue including navy and denim. You can also consider pale blush a neutral color because of my light skin tone.&nbsp; </span></p>

            <p class="blog-sub-heading"><strong><span>WHAT COLOR SHOES CAN GO ALONG WITH&nbsp; NEUTRAL OUTFITS?</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>The easiest shoe to pair with any of your outfits is either black or nude shoes. This limits the shade variation if you&rsquo;re worried about clashing with your outfit. You can pretty much guarantee that having the right nude or black shoe will work with any outfit in your wardrobe. That&rsquo;s why they are both wardrobe staples!</span></p>
            <p><span>When looking for a nude heel, you want to get one that matches your skin tone as close as possible. This can change based on the season if your skin tans easily, so consider having two options in your wardrobe.</span></p>
            <p><span>When it comes to pairing brown shoes with your outfit, you don't have to stress over having the same shade, but all you can do is to try keeping it in the same color family. I usually pair warm browns together (those that lean more camel and orangey), and cool-toned browns together (those that lean more taupe or grey).</span></p>
            <p><span>Of course, do not be hesitant to add in a pop of color, too. If your outfit is head to toe neutral and you&rsquo;re craving a little bit of color, add in a fun colored heel or handbag to brighten up the look. If your accessories don&rsquo;t match perfectly, you can usually pick one or the other. </span></p>

            <p class="blog-sub-heading">Start your online food business with ease. Sell packaged food online
                through these simple steps & see it thrive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:justify; padding:0 15px;">
            <p class="">You might have a knack for baking delicious cookies or cooking smoked Barbeque Chicken in
                your yard. But did you ever come across the idea of taking your passion to the next level? If you did, then this is your time to showcase your creativity to the digital world - by setting up your store online.
            </p>

            <p class="">Having a passion is a good thing. If you are determined to make money out of your passion, you
                couldn’t think of a better option. But what is required to own a business &amp; to run it smoothly?</p>
            <p class="">Businesses might seem to fluster people but the ones who get along with the journey to establish a business, things might work wonders for them.
                Starting a business from scratch whether online or offline demands a lot of brainstorming & planning. When you decide to take your food business online, you might be made to face certain challenges if you do not carry out a comprehensive plan for your business.
            </p>

            <p class="">The problem doesn’t end here. The food industry is vast & has its complexities. Consisting
                mostly of perishable goods, the industry is highly sensitive &amp; often its complicated supply chains
                are affected by poor maintenance, bad weather, or lack of preservation. In India, the FSSAI or Food Safety &amp; Standards Authority of India governs restrictions for entry of a firm in the food market. But at the end of the day, it is the producers and suppliers that have to take care of the rules and make sure that their product doesn’t compromise with quality.
            </p>

            <p class="">Though starting a successful online business dealing in food is not a piece of cake, we have come up with the basics of online business that will help you overcome challenges & let your
                online food business thrive.</p>

            <span class="points-heading">1. Develop an idea</span>
            <br>
            <p class="">Having an idea is the essence of starting an online business. If you make cookies, jams,
                or pickles for your beloved ones and even for your friends, then its an added advantage
                for you because you already have the knowledge of the processes & the criteria to
                preserve them. Brainstorm for a while but dont go too far - just think about why & what
                would you sell online.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">2. Pick up a niche </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">Of course, just deciding your product wouldnt be enough. You have to pick the niche it
                belongs to. This would help in assessing the competition in the market, legal restrictions,
                packaging norms &amp; much more. Besides that, you can also invest some of your time in
                determining the target consumers. Add a tag to your product if you want to attract a
                section or the entire target consumers like Gourmet, Artisanal, Custom, Vegan, Gluten & Allergen-free, organic, & so on.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">3. Adding USPs to your product & putting food trends in use -</span>
            <br>
            <p class="">USPs or unique selling points make your product distinguishable &amp; worth remembering.
                But adding drastically different USPs in food might not be feasible. While ensuring minimum standards of quantity &amp; quality, you can simply analyze trends & craft your product accordingly- like granola bars with low calories can endear a group of health enthusiasts for sure. You can also go with the idea of making your product vegan.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">4. Produce or curate -</span>
            <br>
            <p class="">The quality of food starts from the quality of ingredients. You will have to source
                ingredients through verified suppliers in the market, & check if they are capable of
                holding the promises that you are later going to accrue to your customers. If you plan to
                keep your product, lets say bread as “Certified Organic”, then you will need to verify if
                the ingredients are organically sourced.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">5. Ingredients
            </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">The quality of food starts from the quality of ingredients. You will have to source
                ingredients through verified suppliers in the market, & check if they are capable of
                holding the promises that you are later going to accrue to your customers. If you plan to
                keep your product, lets say bread as “Certified Organic”, then you will need to verify if
                the ingredients are organically sourced.</p>
            <span class="points-heading">6. Production
            </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">For your online food business, you can start from the comfort of your home. But that might create issues if later on you are inundated with endless demands from consumers. But if you have a decent space, then there would be no worries for the time being.
                Team up with your friends or other people who'd help you. Hire apprentices if you like. You can also take a rented kitchen or a workspace to craft your product.
            </p>
            <span class="points-heading">7. Labeling & Packaging
            </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">To start a packaged food business, you’ll have to pay extra attention to its labeling & packaging. Your product wouldn't be recognized as a product without these two elements. For effective labeling & packaging, all you require is to contact a product designer & a printing agency. This will all be done after you ascertain various quantities of your product. Here are some points that'll ease your work:
            </p>
            <ul class="seventh-point-list">
                <li>Design a logo - it must be unique, simple & easy to remember </li>
                <li> Add Nutritional value to packaging</li>
                <li>Ensure good packaging quality of the product</li>
            </ul>
            <nbsp>
                <span class="points-heading">8. Pricing</span>
                <br>
                <p class="">You'd love to make sure if the ROI of your products is sufficient - whether you're getting what you deserve. But pricing is an uphill task. If you're not a fan of accounting or are hesitant to hire someone for the same too early, you can just do one thing - determine your costs & keep adjusting until you get sufficient ROI. Just make sure that you're not withdrawing out of business for unnecessary needs too often or that will complicate things for you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">9. Setting expiry dates & mentioning preserving methods
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">You would love to envision yourself being successful overnight, and becoming an entrepreneur that you always wanted. One thing you wouldn't want for sure is people throwing allegations at you for faulty products. If you lack instructions, it will turn into underplaying with customer's trust & they would end up getting sick. Thus, you'll have to be wary of these considerations. Set an expiry date according to your experience of the product if you were the one who developed it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">10. Inventory
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Generally, the techniques used for keeping the inventory rolling are the First-in-First-out method & the Last-in-First-out method. In your case, you'll have to follow the first method which implies that you'll have to finish the previous inventory first to avoid spoilage. Though it might seem to be complicated, it is a really easy method for balancing your inventory. Also, remember to not pile up inventory too often as it might perish faster.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">11. Determine the form of Payment
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Offline & online food businesses require flexible payment systems to retain their customers. Hence, don’t just stick to one form of payment. Include those payment methods that are prominent and are frequently used by people. Examples are GPay, Paytm, PhonePe & much more. However, if you sell your products on Gharobaar, you won’t have to worry about this factor.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">12. Legality </span>
                <p class="">You can be entirely confident of the quality that you’ll provide to your customers, but not having legal backing would shatter your dreams of owning your business. Thus, obtaining a license would be necessary in this case.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">13. Shipping </span>
                <p class="">Shipping is one of the major headaches of selling food online. But if you partner up with an E-commerce website like Gharobaar, things might become way easier.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">Promotion & Brand Awareness
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Why does social media exist? Is it only for forwarding funny jokes or connecting you with your friends? Well, take a look at some features of social media & you'll get hooked!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="">Social media marketing is one of the desired elements of online promotions. You can use Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn & Twitter to increase your reach to the potential consumers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="">Your product will have to be backed with SEO (Search Engine Optimization). A good SEO score might boost up your sales & improve your online presence. Besides this, you'll also be required to put up product descriptions. If you partner with Gharobaar, you wouldn't have to worry about these things. (That's what counts as a perk for selling your product through E-commerce websites)
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">Team Up
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Bring in your allies, the people with whom you'll be making or curating the product. They will be your core team. Make friends with your Food Security Officer & other retailers dealing in nearly the same products. Partner with them if needed & make a chain where everyone operates in a fair competition.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">Summing up
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Starting anything from scratch is troublesome & annoying, but as you get along the journey & learn new experiences, you become better. Right from the idea of starting a food business online to the execution of that idea, a lot of things demand attention & care.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="">It is worth noting how many steps are involved in setting up an online business. If you sell packaged food products on your website, the onus of promotion will be on your shoulders. Besides this, you will have to keep revising your SEO strategies from time to time & take care of shipping problems. Selling food through an e-Commerce website will cut all these responsibilities & you can focus more on ensuring consistency and quality of your product.

            <p>Amid unending hectic schedules, pollution &amp; stress, we somewhat forget about caring for ourselves. While we would desire flawlessly smooth skin, we rather end up with a paucity of time in our hands.</p>
            <h1 class="points-heading">How to maintain an active skincare regime despite your busy schedule?</h1>
            <p>Skincare is as essential for the body as oil is for machinery. It is better that you strive to rejuvenate the skin and make it look healthier and firm.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>To achieve healthy and resplendent skin, many methods can be adopted. Rather than spending your money on exorbitantly priced skincare goodies, you can use some simple products that will serve the purpose well. </p>
            <h2>Basic skincare essentials in your Wardrobe </h2>
            <p>Next, you should be conscious of what constitutes a safe skin routine. Which is to say, what kinds of things do you need to keep your skin clean and healthy?</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Cleansers&nbsp; </h3>
            <p>The cleanser is what you're going to use to wash your skin, and it's important to use a soap meant for your face &ndash;not just some mediocre bar or body wash. </p>
            <p>You will have to wash your face gently. Remember not to scrub it too harshly. Then, rinse with warm water (not hot water). This is because hot water removes all the natural oils from your skin and causes it to become dehydrated. </p>
            <p>Finding the right cleanser for you might be a process of trial and error. If you have dry skin, you&rsquo;ll want to use one without alcohol or fragrance. If your skin tends to be oily, you&rsquo;ll want to look for an oil-free option, and you may want to consider using a toner as well.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Toners</h3>
            <p>Many people might argue that toners are not needed for a perfect skincare routine, but it is not true. After you wash your face, the toner eliminates the last traces of dirt, grime, and impurity trapped in your pores. It can have a hugely positive effect on the appearance and tightness of your pores when applied to your everyday skincare routine and used regularly. Toners often contain ingredients that replenish and restore nutrients to your skin and can diminish redness and dry patches. </p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Moisturizers</h3>
            <p>Moisturizers are for us, much like cleansers, and should be used any time you wash your face. And like cleansers, when you're searching for the right one, a little trial and mistake is natural. For example, oily skin will benefit from lightweight, oil-free, or gel items. Moisturizers avoid your skin from drying out, leaving your skin smooth and hydrated. When applied, they are most effective while your skin is slightly damp to lock in moisture.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Sunscreens</h3>
            <p>Some moisturizers contain SPF, but doubling up with sunscreen also does not hurt, particularly if your moisturizer has an SPF below 30. You should know the lines well by now: add sunscreen every day, even if it's cold or grey, even if you're bundled up. Re-apply every two hours while you are exposed. Be sure to protect your sunscreen from both UVA and UVB rays. If skin cancer and sun damage are not enough to persuade you, the number one cause of wrinkles, irregular skin tone, loss of firmness, and signs of aging is also UV exposure.&nbsp; </p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Exfoliation</h3>
            <p>Here's a brand you do not need or want to use every day. If you have dry skin, you can exfoliate more than normal, including winter-air-induced dry skin, but you should still sustain it once or twice a week, max. After cleansing, but before moisturizing, exfoliation should be used because it helps to remove flaky skin by increasing the turnover of skin cells. The advantages are real-removing dead skin and building up smoother skin and cleaner pores, but most dermatologists would prescribe chemical exfoliants over scrubs to avoid damage to your skin's protective barrier.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Serum </h3>
            <p>Serums contain ingredients such as antioxidants or retinol that encourage skin health in a variety of ways, such as soothing redness and enhancing texture and firmness, another optional addition to your skincare routine.</p>
            <h1 class="points-heading">What to use &amp; when</h1>
            <p>Not everyone understands dermatology. Some products might suit someone, while they might end up causing trouble for someone else. Thus, it is imperative to understand what products to use, as they get in direct contact with your skin &amp; might cause persistent irritation.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The best way to remember when you should do what your skin needs is to think of it like this: morning skincare should concentrate on daytime prevention and security, and cleaning and repair should be the focus of your nighttime routine. </p>
            <p>Washing their faces once a day can suffice for many people &amp; they might still end up with radiant skin. But this does not happen with everyone. Rinsing with warm water in the morning before applying moisturizer and sunscreen should be adequate, while more dedicated treatment is recommended at night, after a full day of exposure and injury. </p>
            <p>As such,&nbsp; consider washing your face with a cleanser before going to bed to remove dirt and makeup, then, if you like, use toner, exfoliant, and serums. In any event, the moisturizing still stops. </p>
            <p>You should also always wash your face after exercising or working up a sweat, regardless of the time of day, as sweat will clog pores and make acne worse. As a rule, before bed, remember to take your makeup off and stop scratching at your face. </p>
            <h1 class="points-heading">How weather controls your skin behavior&nbsp; </h1>
            <p>The change in the season can lead to changes to your skincare and maybe the items you use, but your routine does not need any significant overhaul. </p>
            <p>It is all about extra moisturizing in the winter. The cold weather (as does the heat from radiators) leads to dryness and wind can also chap the skin. To complement your daily moisturizer, you may want to change to a more moisturizing cleanser. </p>
            <p>In comparison, your skin might be oilier in the summer and you should turn to an oil-free cleanser. Sunscreen is a staple for all seasons, but for everyday use in the summer months, it is fair to switch to a lighter weight-just make sure to break out the heavy-duty stuff for any concentrated time spent in the sun. </p>
            <p>In addition, note that you don't have to wait until the leaves fall or the snow melts to change your skincare routine. If your skin shifts, it is fair to alter your routine in kind, because of the environment, hormones, or something else. </p>

            <p class="points-heading">Points to be noted: </p>
            <ul class="ul-style-type">
                <li>Not every ingredient in any of the body scrubs mentioned above might be friendly to your skin, so before applying a body mask, scrub, or moisturizer on the body, a patch test must be done to check whether it induces an allergic reaction or not. </li>
                <li>Avoid using toner or exfoliator on skin that is chapped, broken, healing from a wound, or sunburned. Applying these products to such parts of the skin may irritate. </li>
                <li>Over-exfoliating can make the skin too dry and can irritate, so if one has sensitive skin, he/she can apply a body scrub once a week, while a person having oily skin can do that twice or thrice in a week. </li>
                <li>Consulting a dermatologist if one has very sensitive skin can be considered too. </li>
                <li>Always ensure that the product you use is composed of quality ingredients to avoid unfavorable skin reactions in the future. </li>

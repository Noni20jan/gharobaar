        <div class="row" style="text-align:justify; padding:0 15px;">
            <p class="">"Beauty attracts the eye" seems to be pretty correct with the present times, where people are now validating handmade articles that are more than run-of-the-mill machinery products. Stuck amid cliches & standards, they are now getting more aesthetic-oriented, craving a change.
            </p>

            <p class="">Artisanal articles are gaining recognition due to their unique designs & the changing fashion trends. You would have come across sellers in trade fairs or similar places, that sell artisanal products. These products are unique & enchanting, thanks to their exquisite craftsmanship & delicacy. </p>
            <p class="">Artisanal jewellery is different from other jewellery, in terms of quality of material, design & style. You won't find Artisanal jewellery in any jewellery store, for they are rarer & put more details to the table.
            </p>

            <p class="">Continue reading to know why Artisanal Jewellery is worth every penny of yours - What it is, how it can go well with your style, or even for gifting someone special.

            <!-- <p class="">Though starting a successful online business dealing in food is not a piece of cake, we have come up with the basics of online business that will help you overcome challenges & let your

            <span class="points-heading">Why Buy Artisanal Jewellery?</span>
            <br>
            <p class="">Machines can save your money but they know no creativity. Consider an example; you can easily buy a readymade traditional suit for your sister's marriage, but you would rather spend more money on getting a custom suit created, with all the elements that you desire. The former would suffice, but nothing would beat the feeling of the latter. The same is with artisanal pieces. Their rarity doesn't compromise with their prices. </p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">Defines Your Fashion Statement</span>
            <br>
            <p class="">If you are a fashion-conscious person, you would love to explore various options in jewellery & accessories around you. You would never settle with banality & always want something that is drastically different & steals the gaze of people, wherever you go. Artisanal renders you a similar hunch & defines your fashion statement. Since they are crafted by different skilled people, their varieties are unique & attractive. </p>
            <br>
            <span class="points-heading">Supporting Small Businesses & Independent Craftsmen </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">You might have to pay a little more for other commercially available products, but they would be worth it. Buying locally, like when you purchase from such sellers, supports the local economy & strengthens customer-seller relationships within that economy. </p>
            <p class="">Self-employed craftsmen or employees display their creativity in the form of clothing, jewellery, food, paintings & a lot more. When you buy from such a person, you support their talent & their livelihood at the same time (feels amazing, right?). .</p>
            </p>
            <p class="">You can buy the best artisanal products online or even from a more established, high-end designer. In this way, you are helping sustain a smaller, more personal level of economic growth that spans the entire supply chain and that's worth preserving, no matter what the zip code.</p>

            <span class="points-heading">Unique Designs
            </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">No matter what you decide to buy, the advantage of making artisan jewellery is that you always get a unique item, no matter what the price point. Even if the designer makes a few pieces that look like you have in mind, no two earrings, rings or necklaces are the same. And that's a lovely thing if you ask us about it</p>
            <br>
            <p class="">
                And while many people are perfectly happy to stick to whatever the look of the day happens to be, the cool thing about owning a one-of-a-kind design is that it often transcends fleeting trends. Be true to your style or celebrate your loved one's fashion sense.

            <span class="points-heading">Highly reliable Material Quality
            </span>
            <br>
            <p class="">In most cases, the materials used to make a handmade piece are of a high degree of quality. Plus, craftspeople tend to be more cognizant of where their materials are from and can identify each part of the sourcing process.
            </p>
            <p class="">Many jewellery makers are committed to sustainability as well as using ethically sourced materials. One of the reasons a lot of custom pieces tend to cost more than their mass-market counterparts is the artist often has a relationship with the refiners and dealers, but may not get the price cuts associated with buying in bulk. Being ethical can be difficult when you're trying to make a buck, but purchasing on a small scale provides a buyer with more transparency as far as supply chain ethics are concerned.</p>
            <p>With many mass-produced jewellery lines, there are a host of ethical dilemmas that emerge, particularly when a company becomes quite large, such as</p>

                <p class="">
                    When you buy from an artisan, they'll have a relationship with the person they're buying metals and stones from, and you'll be able to ask questions about the process, should you be on the lookout for a piece as beautiful as it is ethical. Chances are the designer you choose to buy from will be happy to talk about their process - whether they've got a story about their gold guy or their adventures in sourcing certain hard-to-find materials.

                <p class="points-heading">These days, people are getting more environmentally conscious. Many jewelers work with recycled metals or are reusing stones from vintage pieces, which come with both a history and a lower carbon footprint.

                <span class="points-heading">Clothes or Jewellery: Put either on the focus.
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">When it comes to fashion, you can blindly go with any option & you need to think what exactly you want to emphasize- is it your jewellery you want others to notice, or is it your quirky outfit instead?<br>If your outfit is shimmery or exuberant, try to go with limited pieces of jewellery. On the contract, if your outfit consists of simple clothes like a T-shirt or a jacket, then you can add layers to your jewellery.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">Manage your jewellery.
                </span>
                <br>
                <p class="">Not every event is like a big, fat, Indian wedding in which you can go with heavy earrings as well as a large necklace - it appears too extra. If you are wearing huge earrings with an outfit, go with lighter chains & rings or nothing at all. If the earrings are small, then you can wear noticeable necklaces.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="points-heading">Break the rules.</span>
                <p class="">There are no rules for fashion. But make sure whatever you do goes along with your choices- don't just randomly pick anything. Wear traditional jewellery with western outfits, try adding a shirt with a long skirt & plain canvas shoes or add a jacket, or rather, consider wearing a formal outfit with a light necklace & a pair of elegant earrings.

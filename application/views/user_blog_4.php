Gharobaar is one of the most trusted shopping websites in India for professional attire. Here are some tips for dressing for an interview or any other occasion- make your first impression. </p>

            <p>That last-minute rush of grabbing things, that nervousness, &amp; of course, that paranoia of dressing awful or disappointing interviewers is all you would get reminded of when someone will ask you about your first interview experience. Got chills right? </p>

            <p>Many people are fond of tattoos, piercings, or are overly dressing - which is not wrong though. They might even think of incorporating these elements with their official outfit, but it is not necessary if they would go well with the latter. </p>
            <p>If you are to attend the first interview in your lifetime, make sure you give this article a read &amp; get an idea of preparing yourself. </p>
            <h2 class="points-heading">General Tips to dress up well for your first interview </h2>
            <p>There are no hard &amp; fast rules of dressing appropriately when you are about to attend an official event, show up to a colleague's birthday or are to head out for your first interview. All you require is to create a good impression - because your outfit defines it all. </p>
            <p>Let's imagine, for example, that you're going to an interview with a company where no one wears a suit &ndash; not even the CEO. Are you always expected to dress formally for the occasion, or are you going to look out of place? Even if you plan to take a more relaxed look, how do you make sure that you still look professional and respectful?</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Less is great - </h3>
            <p>Minimalism is the key to validation when it comes to corporate etiquette. The simpler you dress, the better you look. Try not to wear more accessories as they might disproportionately attract attention while you are presenting or giving an interview. If you have tattoos on noticeable parts of your body like arms, legs, neck, collarbone, etc., then try to cover them with your clothes. </p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Make it formal - </h3>
            <p>It is okay to be clad in a pair of well-ironed jeans &amp; a shirt if you are headed for a casual interview. But if the position of the firm matters, you will have to ensure that you do not miss out on formal elements - Tie, shirt, blazer, polished shoes &amp; much more. Be sure of shaving first, but if you prefer to keep your beard as it is, then groom it well. </p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Start by researching the company&rsquo;s dress code -</h3>
            <p>It is not mandatory for employees of every company in your industry to wear the same attire. They might dress casually, wear a certain uniform to work or follow strict guidelines for clothing. Before you show up for the interview, make sure you run some background checks &amp; have an insight into the company's culture.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Choose clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident - </h3>
            <p>Comfort is always above looks. Your first priority should always be comfort. Choose those outfits that complete the bare minimum &amp; fit you perfectly. In case you fail to get a cloth that is not comfortable but goes well with the overall outfit, then it might reflect in your body language, which will further hamper your confidence at the time of the interview.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">&nbsp;Dress according to your best judgment and don&rsquo;t overthink it -</h3>
            <p>Do not ask a lot of people for what to wear &amp; how to wear as you will get different opinions that will leave you confused. Dress according to your best judgment &amp; seek advice from one of your three closest people.</p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Avoid revealing clothing -</h3>
            <p>Ladies, take a note. Revealing a little bit of neck on special occasions is favorable, but when it comes to corporate demeanor, you have to be a little careful. If you accidentally show up to a meeting or an interview with clothing that is not comfortable &amp; revealing, then it might end up creating a poor image in front of other people and would also steal some of your confidence. For guys, it is advised that you make sure all of your buttons on the shirt are in place, as revealing a little bit of chest distorts your corporate image. Also, try not to wear shorts &amp; ankle-length socks. </p>
            <h3 class="points-heading-2">Ensure clothing is ironed and wrinkle-free -</h3>
            <p>Always pick well-ironed &amp; hole-free clothes. Also, make sure there are no stains &amp; pet hairs on your clothes, otherwise, it would end up creating a very bad impression. </p>
            <h2 class="points-heading">Outfit ideas for various occasions: </h2>
            <p><em>For Casual Workplace </em>- </p>
            <p>Keeping it professional, but a little more casual- some companies or organizations follow laxity in dress code, except for some special occasions. For such companies, you can choose the following outfit combinations: </p>

            </ul>

The home is where the heart is. Given a chance, a person would never want to move out of him home. But, in this fast paced life, and in order to make a good living, people are often forced to move out of their homes and live in other cities, away from their homes and parents.

            <span class="user-blog-2-headings">Things that people miss outside their home:</span>
            <p>Well, as such moving out of their homes, people miss a lot of things – they miss their family, their love and care and many other things. But, what people miss the most is the home cooked food. This is because, in our culture, food is not just a mean to satisfy our hunger, it is much more than that. In India, home cooked food gives a mother to show her love for her family members. It’s actually an opportunity to connect and reconnect with your loved ones.

What it simply means is that if you want to really impress a man, give him food to eat that goes beyond his expectation in taste, and bingo, your job is done. And for most people, the food cooked by their mother is the best. No food can beat the taste of mother’s recipe. No wonder, we see many brands in the market, which talk about being the mother’s choice, or as good as mother’s taste. This is because, a mother apart from adding spices to the food, also adds her love and affection. And this love and affection, is what gives a unique taste to the home cooked food.
